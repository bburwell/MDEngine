Title: Congratulations! You've installed MDEngine

## Congratulations!

You've successfully installed **[MDEngine]**. Simply add [Markdown] files to your web root (where you put the `_mdengine` directory) and see your files served.

You can edit some options for MDEngine in the file `settings.php`. Edit the theme files, `views/header.php` and `views/footer.php` to change the layout.

In case of a 404 error, the file at `views/404.md` will be displayed, so edit it if you'd like.

You can specify the content of the `<title>` tag by beginning a Markdown file with `Title: ` followed by a title and a line break.
