Here is a paragraph. It contains a link to <http://mdengine.benburwell.com>. Let's see how this works when we get to multiple lines. Hopefully this'll be enough text to get on to a second line. I guess the only way to tell for sure it to try it out.

Here is some text  
That spans  
Multiple  
Lines.

> Here is some block quoted text.
> It's pretty great.

Color Modes:

* Red
* Green
* Blue

There are three possibilities,

1. One
2. Two
3. Three.

* Here is a list item with several paragraphs.
  
  That was the first, here is the second.

  Here is yet anotherâ€”a _third_.
* In the same list, here is the second item.

Some text can be **bold**, other text can be *italic*.

A small block of code:

    def proc():
        puts 3
    end

Inline code can be written like `this`.
