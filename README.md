About MDEngine
==============

**MDEngine** is a simple website development platform based on [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and PHP.

Create your own template (or use the default) and simply add your Markdown files to your web root and they'll be processed into HTML.

Requires PHP and an Apache server (> 2.2.16) running `mod_dir` in `.htaccess` files.
