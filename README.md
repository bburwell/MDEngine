About MDEngine
==============

**MDEngine** is a simple website development platform based on [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and PHP.

Create your own template (or use the default) and simply add your Markdown files to your web root and they'll be processed into HTML.

Requires PHP and an Apache server (>= 2.2.16) running `mod_dir` in `.htaccess` files.

Installation
============

Simply place the `_mdengine` directory and the `.htaccess` file in the web root of your Apache server. All existing content will act as it did before, and any Markdown files you add will be handled by MDEngine.
