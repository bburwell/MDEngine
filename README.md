About MDEngine
==============

**MDEngine** is a simple website development platform based on [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and PHP.

Create your own template (or use the default) and simply add your markdown files to the `/content/` directory.

MDEngine uses `mod_rewrite` for pretty URLs.

Requires PHP and an Apache server running `mod_rewrite` in `.htaccess` files.
